		{
			"content": "Working closely with Pam, the designer was huge - we were able to tweak the design as we went to improve the final product, and having that instant feedback loop when you create a sweet new feature is hella gratifying. The type treatment on this site is so sick too. Using non-Google / Typekit fonts is super nice and adds that extra special intangible aspect to a site."

		{
			"content": "One of my favourite features on this site is the Masonry / infinite scroll implementation on the blog &amp; recipes pages. Having the freedom to have those ragged grids makes for a look that stands out, and the downsides are totally eliminated by implementing infinite scroll."

			"content": "I love this studio, the product is great, and I'm still super proud of my work on this."
