I loved the design, and working on it taught me a lot about both the technical and creative aspects of web development.</p><p>Working closely with Pam, the designer was huge - we were able to tweak the design as we went to improve the final product, and having that instant feedback loop when you create a sweet new feature is hella gratifying. The type treatment on this site is so sick too. Using non-Google / Typekit fonts is super nice and adds that extra special intangible aspect to a site.</p><p>One of my favourite features on this site is the Masonry / infinite scroll implementation on the blog &amp; recipes pages. Having the freedom to have those ragged grids makes for a look that stands out, and the downsides are totally eliminated by implementing infinite scroll.</p><p>I love this studio, the product is great, and I\'m still super proud of my work on this.</p>",

As tends to happen with these sorts of projects, I went a bit over the top with branding and design for a casual pastime.</p><p>Initially I drew inspiration from a lot of skate brands, but let\'s not talk about that stage of the blog.<br>Eventually I settled on a pixel art style with digital glitch elements, which I think is pretty unique and complements the style of the blog and brand really well. I learned a lot creating the logo animation, and have come to love dithering and pixel art.</p><p>During some down time I decided that I couldnt find a theme that I liked for the blog, so I set out to make one myself - A multi-column, responsive, colourful yet minimal tumblr theme.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/theme/39539" target="_blank">fiendish minimal.</a></p>',
